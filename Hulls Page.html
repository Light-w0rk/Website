			<dt><strong>Wasp</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>Fast, with negligible armor, wasp can outrun any other hull. Its high speed and maneuverability take skill to control, but allow it to perform well on cramped maps. Great with short-range guns.</em></dd>

			<dt><strong>Hornet</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>A light hull for those who want speed without completely trading off it for armor. With its drift feature that allows it to skid around corners, Hornet is a tough hull to maneuver but is nonetheless very steady. Looks great with any gun.</em></dd>

		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Hunter</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>The most verstile hull in the game. It has decent speed for a medium tank and enough armor to handle itself well in battles at any range. Goes well with almost any gun and is a real hunter!</em></dd>

			<dt><strong>Viking</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>A real Viking: wide and incredibly stable. Average movement and maneuverability, but enviable armor. Works well with mid and long-range guns. Its incredibly low hull makes a hard target.</em></dd>

			<dt><strong>Dictator</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>Being the biggest and tallest hull in the game, Dictator inspires fear and commands respect. Its height allows it a higher vantage point from which to fire. On the flip side, this makes it a bigger target. It lacks speed, but has multiple armor plates to make up for it. Works well when outfitted with Railgun.</em></dd>

			<dt><strong>Titan</strong></dt>

			<dt><strong>Mammoth</strong></dt>
				<dd><em>There is no match for this one's armor, although your grandmother would beat it in a race. A fortress of a tank, chosen by those who are in no hurry and prefer to shrug off anything the enemy throws at them. Works best with long-range guns.</em></dd>
