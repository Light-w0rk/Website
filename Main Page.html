		<p id="paragraph1" class="borders"><a href="http://tankionline.com/en/" target="_blank">Tanki Online</a> is a massively played multiplayer game that is worldwide. Players compete with each other. Every tank destroyed is considered a kill and grants the player experience points. The game features many battle modes, such as team modes, as well as a ranking system and many ways to combine equipment and customize tanks. Players are able to choose and try out hundreds of different combinations from the different selections of turrets, hulls, and protrection paints, that fit their taste and playing style. Soon, a new version of Tanki Online would be released that is based off of Unity rather than Flash. In fact, the developers have already allowed closed beta testing to the new version, which means the open release date of <a href="http://tankix.com/en/" target="_blank">Tanki X</a> is right in the front door!</p>

				<dd><p>In Deathmatch mode, unlike in team battle modes, everything depends on you. The battle fund grows a lot faster than in CTFs and TDMs, as you don’t need to go to a certain position to find enemies; they are everywhere. On most maps, you can open fire right from your spawn point. Deathmatch is the simplest and most reliable battle mode when it comes to earning crystals. The battle can be limited by either time or number of kills.</p>

				<dd><p>It’s really easy to play TDM mode. Battle mechanics are very similar to Deathmatch mode. The only difference is that here, players work in teams. The goal is to destroy more tanks than the opposing team. TDM games are limited by either number of kills or time. Every team member is responsible for the result, as the battle’s final score depends on how well and how carefully they play. Also, unlike in Deathmatch mode, players’ spawn points are located at their bases. To start fighting, you need to go to the centre of a map, or even to the opposing team’s base.</p>

            <dt id="capturetheflag"><strong class="battlemodes">Capture the Flag (CTF)</strong></dt>
				<dd><p>Players are divided into 2 teams. The goal is to take and capture the enemy’s flag, and to prevent the opposing team from capturing yours. If you take the flag and then get killed, you lose it and the flag is dropped where you were killed. However, your teammates can retake it and continue. If the flag is touched by an enemy’s tank, it automatically returns to the flag holder (generally in the enemies' base). The same applies to your team’s flag. To capture the flag, you need to pick up the enemy’s flag and bring it to your flag. For the capture to be successful, your flag needs to be at your base. Victory goes to the team who has captured the most flags by the end of the game, or who reaches the target amount of captures specified in the battle settings. CTF mode is the most popular mode in Tanki Online.</p>

				<dd><p>Teams fight for control over certain points on the map. A team gets score-points when the point is under their control and loses score-points when the point is under enemy's control. The more points captured, the more score-points the team gets and the less score-points the team loses. The winner is the team with the most score-points. Team spawn points are close to their bases.</p>

 	    <p>There are a total of 30 ranks in Tanki Online. The higher the rank a player is, the more (modifications of) turrets and hulls they unlock, as well as more advanced and stunning paints. The lowest rank is recruit and the highest rank is Generalissimo. Players ranks when they have earned the required amount of experience points. As shown in the image below, a player has to earn 145 000 experience points to rank from Commander to Generalissimo, while a total amount of 1 400 000 experience points are required to reach the highest rank from the lowest rank.</p>
